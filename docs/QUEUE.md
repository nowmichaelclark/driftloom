# The queue

Written by the brain for Claude Code (the hands). Work top to bottom. Only
what is live is here: the status, the standing rules, the open items, the
known issues and the merge policy. Finished items, the old notes and the
Done list are in `docs/archive/` and `docs/DONE.md`; `docs/README.md` is the
map of all the docs. Mikey's ears come later, in listening albums the brain
builds from the Done list.

**Status, 2026-10-26:** `main` is at v123. Done: items 0-36 and 38-47 (13
stopped at its gate by design), the core's phase 1 (42-46c) and the whole
sound batch, items 54-73 (groups a, b and c merged, #245-#272), with the
album loops in the Done lines re-checked against `main` (#273). **Next:
item 76** (app track: the first loop after the app starts loses its first
notes). Items 74 and 75 are low priority. 37 stays on hold. Then the brain's
Session 26 checks the three groups, builds the labeled album and writes
phase 2's items, which replace the placeholders 48-53 below (see
`docs/BRAIN.md`, "Start here"). A new Claude Code session starts here: read
the standing rules and the merge policy, then take the next item.

**Two tracks:** app work (fixes, redesigns, vibe tuning, new controls) goes
on alongside the core track, as separate PRs; app-track sessions stay out of
`core/`, and core-track items don't wait for the app (`docs/BRAIN.md`, "Two
tracks"). Item 76 is on the app track.

## Standing rules, for every item

- **One PR per item** (split an item into a/b if that is cleaner). Start
  each from the latest `main`, take the next version number, and bump
  `BUILD` and `CACHE` together.
- **Merging:** see "Merge policy" at the end.
- **Measured, not guessed.** Every new voice, texture or kit: level
  calibrated to its layer's median at 0.4 s notes (`measure.mjs --voice`),
  `VOICE_COST` measured by render timing, and the tone probe's 2-5 kHz
  share at or below the flute's. That last one is the coffee-shop test:
  Mikey's north star is that nothing should bother people in a coffee
  shop. Every new profile: its `level` solved so its loops land on the
  catalog median (`measure.mjs --profile <id>`).
- **Refusals** on full and lite for the loops the item touches: melody at
  full quality stays near zero, and lite no worse than the catalog.
- **The core baseline (item 32):** run `node tools/baseline.mjs`. It renders
  a fixed set on the core (40 loops full and lite, every voice, the
  refusals, the costs) and fails on any difference from
  `test/core-baseline.json`. A change that is not meant to change the sound
  must leave it passing; one that is runs `node tools/baseline.mjs
  --update` in the same PR and says in the body what moved and why.
  Nulling against JavaScript (`measure.mjs --null`) is no longer the gate
  for the core; the JavaScript synth is the fallback a phone without the
  core hears and keeps passing its own checks (`--engine js` with
  `--refusals`, `--clicks`, `--endings`) when its code is touched.
- **The balance lock:** run `stats.mjs --check`. If a locked figure moves,
  report which and by how much, re-baseline at `--n 10000`, and say so.
- **Existing loops:** say exactly what changes for specs that already
  exist. Anything not named in the item must render identically.
- **Tests** three times.
- **Taste:** where the item leaves a musical choice open, take the more
  conservative option and write it down in the PR, marked "for Mikey's
  ears". Never guess silently.
- **American English** in new comments, docs and PR text (Mikey,
  2026-09-28). Don't rename identifiers or spec fields for spelling:
  share codes and history depend on them.
- **Stop and leave a note**, rather than push on, if a check can't be met
  or the item turns out to need a decision. Each note is its own file,
  `docs/notes/<item>-<short-name>.md` (the item number leads, so notes
  sort with their items; `docs/notes/README.md` says what goes in one).
  Say so in the PR. Notes before 2026-10-26 are in
  `docs/archive/notes.md`.
- **When a PR is merged,** add one line to `docs/DONE.md`: the PR number,
  the commit preview URL, and what the ears should listen for. (Lines
  before #241 are in `docs/archive/done.md`.)
- **Items that touch `core/`** also follow `core/AGENTS.md` (the core's
  standing rules, and the rules for sound items).
- **Finished items** are in `docs/archive/queue-items.md`, by number: an
  older item cited as "item 46" is the text there.

## 76. The first loop after the app starts loses its first notes (app track)

**App track.** Hands: **Sonnet 5.5, high**. Stay out of `core/`: the fix
belongs in the page's scheduling (`js/engine.js`, `js/synth.js`,
`js/core.js`). If it truly needs a core change, stop and leave a note.

**What the field shows** (Mikey's Moto, Diagnostics on v116, 2026-10-25):
the first loop after the app starts loses its first notes. Six notes were
late at 3.8 s into the page's time, every one "inside the buffer, left out"
(item 41's rule: a note more than 30 ms late is left out, not bunched). They
had been posted 77-82 ms ahead of their start; the render-ahead measured
right after was 133 ms. Later loops were fine.

**What the brain reads in it (unproven; check before relying on it):** the
planner places a note no closer than the render-ahead plus a margin, but
at a cold start there is no render-ahead yet. `Synth.renderAhead` is null
until a note has reached the core, or at best the context's `baseLatency`
(a callback's worth, tens of milliseconds), and `Engine._soonest` then falls
back to its own lead (0.08 s for the loop's start), which matches the 77-82
ms. The core was already rendering 133 ms past the clock, so the first
notes landed inside what it had rendered. Item 41 plans from a
measurement and item 47 assumes a deep buffer when hidden; a cold start
visible has neither.

**What:** until the render-ahead has been measured (no note has reached the
core yet this session), plan every note with a safe margin instead of the
short lead: **the device's reported output latency** (`AudioContext.outputLatency`,
where the browser gives one, else `baseLatency`), **and never less than
250 ms**. Once it is measured, plan from the measurement as item 41 left it.
- It covers every note decided before the first measurement: the first
  loop, and whatever is decided near the clock right after the start (a
  new loop, Next, a tempo change in the first seconds).
- The cost is that sound starts up to a quarter of a second after Play on
  the first loop; nobody can see that. Take the more conservative option
  wherever the choice is open and write it in the PR, "for Mikey's ears".
- The JavaScript synth is unchanged (it has no render-ahead).
- Diagnostics' log of late notes says whether a note was planned from the
  margin or from a measurement, so the next report shows which.

**Yardsticks:**
- **No late notes at a cold start on a phone in Diagnostics** (the item's
  measure): app started from nothing, first loop played to the end, the
  copied Diagnostics report `late: 0` for it, on full and on lite.
- In the harness, first reproduce the failure on `main` (a core that
  renders further ahead than 80 ms from the first note, as
  `node tools/views.mjs --buffer ... --delay ...` models a buffer), then show
  zero late notes in the first loop with the margin, across several seeds.
- Visible behavior after the first measurement unchanged: the latency of a
  mute or re-roll as item 41 measured it, and item 47's hidden planning.
- Steps for the tester in the PR (what to do, what to copy), so his next
  Diagnostics answers whether anything is left.
- Bump `BUILD` and `CACHE` together to the next version; the usual tests
  and checks.

## 74. Clippy pedantic in the files 46 left (low priority)

**Hands:** Sonnet 5.5, high, any session with usage to spare; it may go
between items of the batch, never inside one. **Why:** the core rule
("clean in the files the PR touches") can't be met in eleven files that
carry 405 old pedantic warnings (#238's table: `wave.rs` 69, `timeline.rs`
68, `blocks/compressor.rs` 56, `resample.rs` 41, `param.rs` 38,
`master.rs` 38, `blocks/osc.rs` 31, `blocks/noise_source.rs` 22, `mix.rs`
16, `delay.rs` 16, `blocks/filter.rs` 14). Fix them, or allow a lint
locally with a one-line reason where following it would make the code
worse; one PR, or one per file if that is cleaner. **Yardsticks:** a
refactor: goldens on every mode, baseline and `blocks.txt` unchanged
byte for byte; costs within 1%; `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -W
clippy::pedantic` reports zero, and CI gains that check so it stays
zero.

## 75. The reverb, rate-true for steady tones (low priority, after the batch)

**Hands:** Opus 5.5, high. From item 62 (brain, 2026-10-20).

**Why:** the reverb's combs (feedback 0.8) catch a held tone differently at
each sample rate: a held sine into the chords channel spreads 1.1 dB across
rates, while the channel itself is the same at every rate. Matching the comb
loops' lengths in time alone didn't fix it (the loop's lowpass and the delay's
interpolation matter too). The chapel organ, a held instrument with a room
send, is the first sound it shows in: golden 16-grove (5 s, the organ) reads
+0.29 dB at 44.1 kHz and +0.34 at 96 kHz against 48 kHz, so
`core/golden/rates.txt` marks it `steady` and `tools/rates.mjs` holds it to
0.4 dB, every other list to 0.2.

**Aim:** 48 kHz bit-identical (goldens and baseline unchanged), and every rate
list back inside 0.2 dB, so the 0.4 dB tolerance (and the `steady` line) can be
removed. If 48 kHz must move, stop and leave a note for a decision.

## Next picks, wired for real (items 48-53)

**Read first:** `design/next-picks.md` (the design Mikey chose on
2026-10-13, Painter session 5) and `docs/CORE.md`, promise 11 (the
request). The design shows five lines of picks for new loops: moods
(today's vibes), tempo and length, key and scale, style (profile) and
voices. Each is **pinned**, **ranged** or left to **any** (chance).

**What already exists (app track, Painter 6):** the screens, with
moods wired to vibes, and length and tempo wired to today's JavaScript
generator only where cheap, clamped to what it can play (bars from the
profile tables, 2 to 32; tempo 32 to 190 bpm). Tempo, key, style and
voices can't be tapped until their pickers are designed. These items
replace that plumbing with the real thing, in the core.

**Where they sit in the phases.** They are not a phase of their own:
items 48-52 belong to **phase 2** (the generator in Rust, built around
the request) and item 53 to **phase 3** (off the page). The brain's
review orders them among phase 2's own items when it writes them
(Session 26, after the sound batch; moved from Session 24); 48
goes first, since the others stand on it. Don't start them before phase
2 starts: the generator they change is the Rust one.

**Rules for these items** (on top of the standing rules and the core
rules in `core/AGENTS.md`):
- **When nothing is picked, nothing changes.** Every loop with all five
  lines on "any" renders exactly as it did before the item (goldens,
  `tools/baseline.mjs`, the balance lock). A pick may only change loops
  that asked for it. Leaving a choice to chance draws from the seed as
  today, with no extra draws that shift the rest.
- **Requests bend the music, never break it** (promise 11). A pin that
  pulls against a profile's character finds its in-between, as vibes do.
  Only a request that truly can't be met says so, in a short plain line
  (the "can't do that" message; its look is a Painter question, until
  then plain text in the panel).
- **Picks shape loops still to come, never the one playing**, and they
  hold through re-rolls and "Let the loop wander": every new loop and
  every wandered pass honors them. In an album, the album decides and
  the picks wait (the design hides them there).
- **Measure that a pick is honored in the render**, not only in the
  spec: tempo from the note onsets, bar count from the cycle, scale and
  key from the pitch classes, voices and layers from what sounds. A test
  walks every pickable choice (promise 11's measure).
- **A picker the design doesn't have yet** (tempo, key and scale, style,
  voices, as of 2026-10-13): build the request side and its tests; the
  app's line stays untappable until a Painter session designs the
  picker. Don't invent the UI.
- **Taste:** where an item leaves a musical choice open, take the
  conservative one and mark it "for Mikey's ears", as always.

Hands: chosen at the phase review. The brain's suggestion: 48 and 49
Opus 5.5, high (the request's shape; sectioned generation); 50-52
Sonnet 5.5, high (clear specs on 48's pattern); 53 Opus 5.5, high
(playback, phase 3).

## 48. The request, end to end, with tempo (phase 2)

**Why:** promise 11. One request for everyone: the app's panel, a
developer's code and a game's events build the same thing. Tempo is
the simplest pick to prove it with.

**What:**
- The Rust generator takes a **request**: for each choice, pinned,
  ranged or chance. Start with vibes (as today's selection) and tempo;
  leave room for the rest without building them (48's design is what
  49-52 follow, so keep it small and documented).
- **Tempo:** pinned ("77 bpm") or a range ("70-85 bpm", the design's
  example). A range draws from the seed inside it. Profiles with gaits
  draw tempo and meter together today: a pinned or ranged tempo picks
  the gait that fits and bends the tempo inside it. When style is left
  to chance, prefer profiles whose band holds the tempo; when style is
  pinned too and its band doesn't, play the profile at the asked tempo
  (conservative: honor the pin; "for Mikey's ears"). The core's limit
  is the core's to set; the app's picker range is the Painter's.
- The app builds the request from the panel and sends it with each new
  loop; today's vibes selection becomes part of it. Remove Painter 6's
  clamped tempo plumbing.
- Share codes: a loop made from a request reproduces from its code.
  (Short codes that carry only the pins are phase 6.)
- The "can't do that" line, for whatever request truly can't be met.

**Yardsticks:**
- Nothing picked: goldens, baseline and balance lock unchanged.
- Pinned tempo: measured bpm within 0.5 of the pin on every target,
  across 200 seeds and every profile.
- Ranged tempo: every loop inside the range; over 500 seeds, the draws
  cover the range (no clumping at one end; report the spread).
- Same request and seed, same samples on every target.
- A test that walks the request's choices (it grows with 49-52).

## 49. Length, up to 32,768 bars and Endless (phase 2)

**Why:** Mikey, 2026-10-13: far longer loops than today's 32 bars, the
app's picker to 32,768 bars plus Endless; no cap in the core (charter,
promise 11). The design's Length picker already exists (Painter 6).

**What:**
- **Pinned length**, any whole number from 1 bar up, and **Endless**.
  The generator works a **section at a time**: memory and cost are the
  same for 4 bars, 32,768 or Endless, and any section is reachable
  straight from the seed and its number, without generating what comes
  before (so a long piece can later be jumped into).
- **What fills a long piece, until long-form composing exists:**
  sections drawn the way "Let the loop wander" draws its next pass,
  holding the request's other picks (key, tempo, style, voices, vibes).
  Writing a piece with an arc (themes that return, a symphony's
  journey, or long slow wandering) is later composing work by ear, its
  own item; this item only makes sure it needs no rework. Conservative,
  "for Mikey's ears".
- A short pinned length (1, 2, 3 bars) plays as a loop of that length,
  honored even where today's profile tables never draw it.
- Length left to chance: today's draws, unchanged.
- The Length picker's play time ("bars · ≈ 45-55 s", "≈ 3-4 hours")
  comes from the request's tempo range, from one function the app and
  the core share, so the two never disagree.
- Remove Painter 6's clamped length plumbing (bars beyond today's
  tables now come from the core).

**Yardsticks:**
- Nothing picked: unchanged, as above.
- Pinned length: the rendered cycle is exactly that many bars (1, 2, 3,
  7, 24, 32, 1,024 and 32,768, every profile).
- Section *n* rendered straight from the seed equals section *n* reached
  by rendering through, sample for sample (hash), for *n* up to 1,000
  and for the last section of a 32,768-bar piece.
- Memory after `Core::new` and cost per section flat from 4 bars to
  Endless (the core rules: no allocation after `Core::new`).
- Endless plays for a 24-hour render without drift or growth (in CI,
  the command-line renderer at speed).

## 50. Key and scale (phase 2)

**Why:** line three of the design: "any key", or a pinned home note and
scale (major, minor, dorian, pentatonic and the rest).

**What:**
- Key (home note) and scale, each pinned, ranged (a set: "D or G";
  "any minor-ish mode") or chance. Follow 48's request pattern.
- **Vibes and scale:** today's vibes pull the mode (and cinder and
  shatter borrow bright modes when glad). A pinned scale wins; the vibes
  then lean everything else. A pinned scale against a profile's
  character finds its in-between ("no pair is forbidden").
- Profiles with fixed modes (wayfare's minor v, cinder's added F over
  E: Mikey's decisions stand) keep those features where the pinned
  scale allows them; say per profile what a pin changes.
- The app's line: values shown ("D dorian"); untappable until the
  picker is designed.

**Yardsticks:**
- Nothing picked: unchanged.
- Pinned key and scale: the loop's pitch classes stay in the scale
  (borrowed chords the profile is known for excepted, listed) and its
  tonic is the pinned key, measured from the render across 200 seeds
  and every profile.
- Refusals on full and lite for pinned scales no worse than the
  catalog.

## 51. Style (profile) (phase 2)

**Why:** line four: "any style", or one or several of Driftloom's
profiles (cinder, tide, wayfare, shrine and the rest).

**What:**
- Style pinned to one profile, or a set ("tide or shrine"); chance as
  today. Each profile keeps its own character, instruments and drums;
  vibes bend it within that character, as today.
- A pinned style with other pins that pull against it (tempo outside
  its band, a scale it doesn't use) follows 48 and 50: honor the pins,
  find the in-between, "can't do that" only if truly impossible.
- The app's line: the profile names; untappable until the picker is
  designed.

**Yardsticks:**
- Nothing picked: unchanged (the balance lock guards what plays on
  chance).
- Pinned style: every loop is that profile; a set draws only from the
  set, each member reached across 500 seeds.
- Per profile, `stats.mjs` figures for pinned-style loops match the
  same profile's loops drawn on chance, within stated tolerances (a
  pin picks a profile; it doesn't change it).

## 52. Voices, and which layers play (phase 2)

**Why:** line five: "any voices", or chosen instruments per layer
(melody, chords, bass, texture, drums), and layers left out (fewer
layers is welcome variety).

**What:**
- Per layer: a voice pinned or a set, or chance; and the layer on, off
  or chance. Follow 48's pattern.
- **The rarities stay rare:** the choir (about 1 loop in 30) is not
  forced by picking melody and chords voices; it can be asked for only
  if the voice list offers it by name. Conservative: not offered until
  Mikey says so.
- A voice pinned onto a profile that never uses it plays at its
  measured level (each voice already sits at its layer's median) and
  passes the refusals; say which combinations needed care.
- All layers off is the one obvious "can't do that".
- The app's line: values shown ("kalimba, marimba"); untappable until
  the picker is designed.

**Yardsticks:**
- Nothing picked: unchanged.
- Pinned voices and layers: what sounds is what was asked, per layer,
  measured from the render across 200 seeds and every profile.
- Levels: pinned-voice loops land on the catalog's level spread
  (`measure.mjs --profile`), no layer louder than its median allows.
- Refusals on full and lite no worse than the catalog.

## 53. The picks through the core's commands (phase 3)

**Why:** phase 3 moves the whole core off the page; the page only sends
commands and draws events. The picks become a command like the rest,
and long pieces and Endless play from the core alone.

**What:**
- The panel's request is sent as a command; the core holds it and
  applies it to every new loop, re-roll and wandered pass. No pick
  logic left on the page.
- Long pieces and Endless play with the page asleep, hidden or busy
  (promise 1's stall test), with no lookahead on the page.
- Now Playing's pills, the panel and the Length picker's play time read
  from the core's events, so what they show is what the core will play.
- Long-piece display on Now Playing (where you are, time left, Endless
  with no "time left": `docs/PAINTER.md`, section 2) only once a Painter
  session has designed it; until then, today's clock.

**Yardsticks:**
- Promise 1's stall test clean with a 32,768-bar piece and with
  Endless.
- A pick made while a loop plays changes the next loop, never the
  current one.
- Picks survive the page being hidden and shown again, and a reload
  (stored as the vibes are today).

## 37. Word albums on `/rank`: one word, "does it fit?"

**On hold (Session 16): skip it unless the brain's State says otherwise.**
Vibes in the app (item 38) may do this job better: Mikey picks a vibe and
tells the brain which loops fit.

Mikey's idea (2026-10-11): "Is this playlist heartwarming? Which songs are
not?" The brain sends a word album (item 35b); Mikey answers each track
with one tap. The pilots, "Heartwarming?" and "Joyful?", went out as
plain albums (`docs/ALBUMS.md`); **if the brain's State says the pilot
didn't work, skip this item.**

- **`rank.html?album=<DLA1 code>`** (the word from the album's title,
  "Heartwarming?" -> heartwarming; `&word=` overrides): plays the album's
  loops in order, each as composed (`driftOn = false`, as now), looping
  until answered. Shows only the question, "Heartwarming?", and the track
  number of the total; no profile, mood or title per track.
- **Buttons:** Fits, Doesn't fit, Not sure; Undo goes back one. A track
  can be answered while it plays; the next starts at once.
- **Record** each answer as a line in the same export, so `ranks.mjs`
  reads it with the rest: `trial`, `build`, `code`, `album` (the album
  code's first block and the word, enough to tell albums apart), `track`,
  `words: [word]`, `taps: [word]` for fits and `[]` for doesn't fit,
  `answer: "fits" | "no" | "unsure"`, `seconds`, `quality`. Saved as
  `/rank` saves now; Export and Clear as they are.
- **`ranks.mjs`** counts album answers apart from the five-word trials
  (per album: fits, doesn't fit, not sure), and `--fit` uses them (item
  35a). The five-word trial stays as it is without `?album=`.
- No hidden repeats in albums (they are short); no generator, synth or
  share-code change; the balance lock doesn't move. The page plays the
  core like the app (item 32's note: `/rank` still builds the JavaScript
  `Synth`; wire it to the core here, with `?engine=js` as the fallback,
  and say what changed). Bump `BUILD` and `CACHE`.
- **Checks:** both pilot album codes in `docs/ALBUMS.md` open, play and
  record on the core and `?engine=js`; an export holding both kinds of
  line reads in `ranks.mjs`; tests three times.

## Later, not queued

Mikey liked the fiddle, accordion and drone as they are, and may want
more nuance in them later. Not now. New instruments are welcome again
(Mikey, 2026-10-09; the 2026-09-25 pause was temporary): the ears-approved
sounds are queued after the core becomes the default, built in the core
one at a time with the refusal and level checks (`docs/BRAIN.md`, State).
Inspiration comes only from wholesome, comforting music.

## Known issues

- **"Let the loop wander" repeats itself since item 44** (Mikey,
  2026-10-18). Since #211 each pass's wandering is drawn from the loop's
  code and the pass number, so replaying a saved loop wanders exactly as
  it did last time, at every slider setting. Mikey: the wander slider
  (0 to 2.4) says how far a loop wanders, and **all the way to the right
  it should feel experimental: not repeatable.** Not urgent. Brain's
  sketch for when it is queued (the generator's port, phase 2, is the
  natural place): the core's draws stay a pure function of what the host
  sends (promise 3 holds); the host adds a per-play salt to the wander's
  seed across the slider's whole upper range (**decided by Mikey,
  2026-10-18**; where that range starts is to be tuned by ear as we
  go), so the same code with the slider lower still wanders the same
  way, and a share code or export says which it was.
  **Where it is written down (brain, Session 24, 2026-10-19):** to be
  built in phase 2's port, not before; carried in `docs/CORE.md` (phase
  2, beside the octave fix) and in `docs/BRAIN.md` ("Start here"), so
  whoever writes phase 2's items queues it. Until then the sound batch
  leaves it as it is: item 54's per-loop choices are drawn once a loop
  and are not redrawn by the wander, whatever the slider says (item 67's
  kick swap aside); with the salt, the upper range's wandering would vary
  play to play, while the loop's choices stay its own.

## Merge policy

Mikey decides this line:

- (yes, from Mikey) When CI is green and every check above passes, Claude
  Code merges its own PR and starts the next item.
