// nothing from any layer and a re-rolled bass cannot turn the choir on or

// still renders the loop it always rendered.
//
// It is annotated only when the two notes are close enough in time to be
// one gesture. A slide joins notes a player did not re-articulate between;
// across a rest you take a breath and start the next note cleanly. Over
// the corpus, 64% of consecutive wind-melody notes are legato or
// overlapping outright, so this is the common case rather than a rare one.
