//! Note lists: everything the core needs to render a loop with no
//! JavaScript, and a host that renders one (queue item 42).
//!
//! A note list is plain ASCII text, one fact per line, because it is
//! committed beside the hashes it produces and a diff of it should be
//! readable. The page's host (`js/core.js`) makes the same few calls to the
//! core whatever it plays -- `param`, `damp`, `key`, `set`, `event` and
//! `note` -- so a note
//! list is those calls, in the order the synth made them, and nothing else. `tools/golden-export.mjs` writes
//! them; this file reads them. Every number is written the way JavaScript
//! prints a double (the shortest text that reads back exactly) and read
//! back exactly, so a list is bit for bit what the host sent.
//!
